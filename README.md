# Tic-Tac-Toe Microservices

Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game with customizable board size and win conditions. Play solo or with friends through invitation links, real-time chat, and leaderboards.

## Game Features

- **Customizable Board Size**: Play on boards from 3x3 to 10x10
- **Flexible Win Conditions**: Set custom win sequence length (3-5 in a row)
- **Solo Mode**: Practice against AI with adjustable difficulty
- **Multiplayer**: Play with friends through invitation links
- **Real-time Chat**: Communicate with opponents during games
- **Leaderboards**: Track wins, losses, and rankings
- **Game History**: Review past games and moves
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML + Nginx (simplified version for MVP)
- **Gateway**: Fiber (Go) - API Gateway
- **Services**:
  - Auth Service - authentication and authorization
  - User Service - user management and profiles
  - Game Service - game logic with DDD approach
  - Chat Service - real-time player communication (WebSocket)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with separate databases for each service
- **Shared Package**: common code in pkg/ to reduce duplication
- **Testing**: BDD tests with Godog for each service

## Ports

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`
- Auth Service: `http://localhost:8081`
- User Service: `http://localhost:8082`
- Game Service: `http://localhost:8083`
- Chat Service: `http://localhost:8084`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
cd infra && docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker ps

# View logs
cd infra && docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
cd infra && docker-compose down
```

### Health Check

After startup, verify service availability:

```bash
# Frontend
curl http://localhost:3000

# API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8080

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
curl http://localhost:8082/health
curl http://localhost:8083/health
curl http://localhost:8084/health
```

### Web Interface

Open in browser: **http://localhost:3000**

You will see a beautiful HTML page with status check for all services and game interface.

### Game Setup

1. **Create Account**: Register to track your statistics
2. **Choose Game Mode**: 
   - Solo vs AI (adjustable difficulty)
   - Multiplayer (invite friends)
3. **Configure Board**: Select size (3x3 to 10x10) and win sequence length
4. **Start Playing**: Make moves and chat with opponents
5. **View Leaderboards**: Check rankings and achievements

## Testing

```bash
# Run BDD tests for specific service
cd services/auth && godog run tests/

# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

## Logging

All services log to shared volume `logs`. Logs are saved to files:

- `frontend.log` - frontend logs (Nginx)
- `gateway.log` - API Gateway logs
- `auth-service.log` - authentication service logs
- `user-service.log` - user service logs
- `game-service.log` - game service logs
- `chat-service.log` - chat service logs
- `postgres.log` - database logs

### Log management commands:

```bash
# View logs for specific service
make logs-gateway
make logs-auth
make logs-game

# View all logs
make logs-all

# View only errors
make logs-error

# Log statistics
make logs-stats

# Clear logs
make logs-clear
```

## Databases

Created automatically:
- `auth_db` - for authentication service
- `user_db` - for user service
- `game_db` - for game service
- `chat_db` - for chat service

## Architecture Benefits

### Shared Package (pkg/)
- **config/** - common configuration for all services
- **middleware/** - reusable middleware (CORS, authentication, logging)
- **database/** - common functions for PostgreSQL
- **utils/** - utilities (JWT, HTTP responses, logging)
- **models/** - common data models

### DDD Approach for Game Service
- **domain/** - domain logic isolated from infrastructure
- **Aggregates** - Game as main aggregate with board state and players
- **Value Objects** - Board, Move, WinCondition as immutable objects
- **Entities** - Player as entity with identifier and statistics
- **Domain Services** - game logic, AI opponent, win detection in logic.go

### BDD Testing
- **tests/** - test folder for each service
- **.feature files** - scenarios in Gherkin language
- **Godog** - BDD framework for Go
- **Test coverage** - all critical scenarios

### Game Modes and Features
- **Classic Mode**: Traditional 3x3 board with 3-in-a-row win
- **Extended Mode**: Larger boards (4x4 to 10x10) with custom win sequences
- **AI Opponent**: Multiple difficulty levels for solo play
- **Invitation System**: Share game links with friends
- **Real-time Updates**: Live game state synchronization
- **Chat Integration**: In-game messaging between players
- **Statistics Tracking**: Win/loss ratios and performance metrics

### Using Shared Package
```go
// In each service
import (
    "github.com/your-org/go-tic-tac-toe/pkg/config"
    "github.com/your-org/go-tic-tac-toe/pkg/middleware"
    "github.com/your-org/go-tic-tac-toe/pkg/database"
    "github.com/your-org/go-tic-tac-toe/pkg/utils"
)
```
